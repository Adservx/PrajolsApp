- [ ] Test on Android: `npm run android` OR scan QR code in Expo Go app
- [ ] Verify app launches successfully

## Step 5: Create Test Users

In Firebase Console â†’ Authentication:

- [ ] Create admin user: admin@school.com
- [ ] Create teacher user: teacher@school.com
- [ ] Create student user: student@school.com
- [ ] Create parent user: parent@school.com

In Firestore Database â†’ users collection:

- [ ] Add user documents with proper roles
- [ ] Verify user data structure matches schema

## Step 6: Verify Features

## Step 8: Build Configuration

- [ ] EAS CLI installed: `npm install -g eas-cli`
- [ ] EAS login completed: `eas login`
- [ ] EAS configured: `eas build:configure`
- [ ] Verify `eas.json` created

## Step 9: Development Build (Optional)

- [ ] Build development APK: `eas build --platform android --profile development`
- [ ] Wait for build completion (~10-15 minutes)
- [ ] Download and install APK on device
- [ ] Verify app works on physical device

## Step 10: Testing

- [ ] Run unit tests: `npm test`
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Type check passes: `npm run type-check`
- [ ] Linting passes: `npm run lint`

## Production Readiness

### Code Quality
- [ ] No console.log statements in production code
- [ ] All TypeScript errors resolved
- [ ] All ESLint warnings addressed
- [ ] Code follows project conventions

### Security
- [ ] All API keys stored in environment variables
- [ ] No sensitive data hardcoded
- [ ] Firebase security rules configured
- [ ] HTTPS enforced for all API calls

### Performance
- [ ] Images optimized
- [ ] Large lists use FlatList/virtualization
- [ ] Animations run at 60 FPS
- [ ] App size is reasonable

### Documentation
- [ ] README updated with project specifics
- [ ] API endpoints documented
- [ ] Component usage documented
- [ ] Deployment process documented

## Common Issues Resolution

### "Module not found" errors
- [ ] Run `npm install` again
- [ ] Clear Metro cache: `npm start -- --clear`
- [ ] Delete node_modules and reinstall

### Firebase connection errors
- [ ] Verify `google-services.json` location
- [ ] Check Firebase config values
- [ ] Ensure Firebase services are enabled

### Build failures
- [ ] Clear cache: `expo start -c`
- [ ] Update Expo SDK: `expo upgrade`
- [ ] Check EAS build logs for specific errors

### App crashes on startup
- [ ] Check error logs in Metro bundler
- [ ] Verify all required dependencies installed
- [ ] Check for syntax errors in code

## Next Steps

Once all items are checked:

1. âœ… **Development**: App is ready for active development
2. âœ… **Testing**: Begin comprehensive testing
3. âœ… **Deployment**: Follow DEPLOYMENT.md for production release

## Quick Command Reference

```bash
# Development
npm start                    # Start Metro bundler
npm run android              # Run on Android
npm run ios                  # Run on iOS

# Testing
npm test                     # Run unit tests
npm run test:coverage        # Test with coverage
npm run type-check           # TypeScript check
npm run lint                 # ESLint check

# Building
eas build --platform android # Build for Android
eas submit --platform android # Submit to Play Store

# Troubleshooting
npm start -- --clear         # Clear cache and restart
rm -rf node_modules && npm install  # Reinstall dependencies
```
