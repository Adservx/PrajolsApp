# Critical Fix Required

## Problem
Your app has conflicting Firebase packages installed:
- ✅ `firebase` (Web SDK - **NEEDED for Expo**)
- ❌ `@react-native-firebase/app`, `@react-native-firebase/auth`, etc. (**NOT compatible with Expo**)

These conflicting packages can cause runtime errors and login failures.

## Solution

### Step 1: Remove Conflicting Packages
Run this command to uninstall the React Native Firebase packages:

```bash
npm uninstall @react-native-firebase/app @react-native-firebase/auth @react-native-firebase/firestore @react-native-firebase/storage @react-native-firebase/messaging
```

### Step 2: Clear Cache and Reinstall
```bash
# Clear npm cache
npm cache clean --force

# Remove node_modules and lock file
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json

# Reinstall dependencies
npm install
```

### Step 3: Restart Expo with Clear Cache
```bash
npx expo start --clear
```

## Why This Is Necessary

**Expo Managed Workflow:**
- ✅ Uses Firebase Web SDK (`firebase` package)
- ❌ Cannot use React Native Firebase (`@react-native-firebase/*`)
- Native modules require ejecting from Expo or using Expo bare workflow

**If You See This Error:**
```
Error: You attempted to use a firebase module that's not installed on your Android project
```

This confirms you have the wrong Firebase packages installed.

## After Fixing

Once the conflicting packages are removed:
1. Your app will only use the Web SDK
2. All authentication will work through the Web SDK
3. No more native module errors

## Verification

After completing the steps, verify your `package.json` contains:
- ✅ `"firebase": "^10.7.1"` (or similar version)
- ❌ NO `@react-native-firebase/*` packages

Then test login again!
