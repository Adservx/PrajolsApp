# Database Error Fix Summary

## Issue
When attempting to register/login, users encountered the error:
```
Database error saving new user
```

## Root Cause
The Supabase Auth service had a database trigger `on_auth_user_created` that automatically runs when a new user signs up. This trigger called the `handle_new_user()` function, which was trying to insert a record into a table called `public.profiles`. However, your database schema uses a table named `public.users` instead of `public.profiles`.

### Error Details from Logs
```
ERROR: relation "public.profiles" does not exist (SQLSTATE 42P01)
500: Database error saving new user
```

## Solution Applied

### 1. Database Migration (First Fix)
Applied migration `fix_handle_new_user_function` that updated the `handle_new_user()` function to:
- Insert into `public.users` table (instead of `public.profiles`)
- Use correct column names: `id`, `email`, `role`
- Properly cast role to `user_role` enum type
- Set admin role for `imserv67@gmail.com`, student for others

### 2. Database Migration (Second Fix)
Applied migration `fix_user_role_enum_reference` to fix enum type reference issue:
- Added explicit schema prefix `public.user_role` for enum type
- Set proper `search_path` for the function to avoid schema resolution issues
- This fixed the error: `ERROR: type "user_role" does not exist`

### 3. Code Changes
Updated `w:\wg\ny\PrajolsApp\hooks\useAuth.ts`:
- Removed manual user profile creation code from `signUp()` function
- The database trigger now handles user profile creation automatically
- Simplified the signup flow

## How It Works Now

1. User signs up via `supabase.auth.signUp()`
2. Database trigger `on_auth_user_created` automatically fires
3. Trigger calls `handle_new_user()` function
4. Function creates user record in `public.users` table with:
   - `id`: Auth user ID
   - `email`: User email
   - `role`: 'admin' for imserv67@gmail.com, 'student' for others
   - `created_at`: Auto-generated timestamp

## Testing
Try registering a new user now. The error should be resolved and user profiles will be created automatically.

## Note
The role selection in the registration UI is currently not functional since the trigger sets the role automatically. If you need custom role assignment during registration, you'll need to either:
1. Add an UPDATE RLS policy for users
2. Or handle role assignment through an admin interface after signup
